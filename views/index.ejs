      Tech Stack: The Building Blocks
    </h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      I crafted this project using a blend of technologies that synergize seamlessly:
    </p>
    <ul class="u-list">
      <li class="list-item">
        <span class="emphasis">MongoDB with Mongoose:</span> MongoDB proved to be the perfect partner for data
        storage,
        with Mongoose adding a layer of elegance to the database interactions, making data management a breeze.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <span class="emphasis">Express and Node.js:</span> I harnessed the power of Express, a fast Node.js framework,
        to lay the groundwork for the backend. Its routing prowess and middleware support were essential for creating
        a
        robust foundation.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <span class="emphasis">Passport and Authentication:</span> For authentication, Passport came to the rescue. By
        integrating passport-local and several of its most popular strategies, I ensured secure user authentication
        with
        password hashing via bcryptjs.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <span class="emphasis">Session Management:</span> Express-session and connect-mongodb-session stepped in to
        handle session management, ensuring a secure and scalable user experience.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <span class="emphasis">Validation Vigilance:</span> Express-validator stood guard, keeping user inputs in
        check
        and fortifying the app against potential vulnerabilities.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <span class="emphasis">EJS Templating:</span> I wielded EJS to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces
        on
        the frontend, delivering a compelling user experience.
